# drinks-for-all
Project #1 for UofM coding Bootcamp - Cocktail Recipe finder and icebreaker

## Description

This project was undertaken as the first major project assesment for the U of M Fullstack Bootcamp course. Titled "Drinks for All", the project is intended as an opportunity for us to deomonstrate all we have learned in the first third of the Fullstack Bootcamp. Using our introductocy knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and API's, we worked to develop a basic web application that applies these concepts and delivers on the user story. This project helped us all further our understanding and use of implementing API's in a professional-like environment, working in small teams to collaborate and build out an MVP in scope of what we've studied.

## Installation

No installation needed. Link to web application here:

## Usage

This project uses JavaScript and server-side API's to create an interactive user experience. Users will be able to enter an alcohol or ingredient of their choice and find a selection of random coktails containig that alcohol/ingredient. Additionally, should a user feel bold enough to try something new, there is also an option to select a random cocktail from the list of over 630 availble recipes in the API. Finally, each iteration of searching for coktails will generate a new and corny dad joke; the perfect way to break the ice with your new drink of choice! User will be initially taken to a homepage with a description and directions on how to use the app. After entering their alcohol or ingredient of choice and clicking 'Submit' (or 'Random' for the bold!), the user will be taken to a search results page that displays three viable cocktails based on their search parameters. Users will also be able to search again from the search results page using the provided aside with the same search capabilities as the home page. Screenshots are provided below:
