        <p class="m-4 p-6">This application is to help find a drink for everyone (of age of course). By putting in
            your alcohol of choice in the search bar, the application will spit out a list of Drinks
            that are made with that choice as well as how to make them. Not sure of what to make? Don't worry, just
            press the randomize button in the bottom right to have our app randomly select a drink for you! </p>
